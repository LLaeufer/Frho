# Interpreter for Frho
This is an interpreter for the programming language Frho.

Frho is a programming language defined in an as yet unpublished manuscript by Peter Thiemann from the University of Freiburg and Taro Sekiyama from National Institute of Informatics, Japan.

Preliminary definitions for the [syntax](syntax.md), big-step [semantics](semantics.md) and [type-checker](typechecker.md) can be found in this repository. These definitions are based on the unpublished manuscript, personal communication with Peter Thiemann and got adapted my me (L. LÃ¤ufer) to fit the concrete implementation of the interpreter better.

## Requirements

This interpreter can be run on a Linux or macOS machine, with the Rust compiler and Cargo installed.

## Running the interpreter

Frho programs can be executed by running

`cargo run interpret <path>` or `cargo run debug <path>` respectively.

For all options see `cargo run help`

## Running the tests

This implementation contains over 200 tests confirming the correct function of this interpreter.

These can be run via the terminal by running: `cargo test`

## Building the interpreter

Frho can be build into a standalone application by running
`cargo build --release`. The resulting executable can be found at `target/release/frho`. The application can be then run like `./frho interpret <path>`.
